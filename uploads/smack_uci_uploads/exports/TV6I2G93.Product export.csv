"Let’s Go Beyond Egg-Spectations";"84879";"It’s like the old saying goes; you can’t make an omelet without cracking a few eggs. The volunteers at Sistering are looking to do just that, by adding hot eggs to their weekday breakfast menu. Sistering will often see over 200 women for three meals every day who have little to no food security. Right now, there just isn’t enough room to cook eggs for that many people. We’re looking to help the Sistering Kitchen increase their cooking capacity by pooling funds to purchase an electric griddle. Your contribution would help the Sistering team provide a hot breakfast to at-risk, socially-isolated women in Toronto who are homeless or precariously housed.

The kitchen at Sistering is truly the heart of the centre and it’s often the most important part of the Sistering spirit. Sistering has been serving this community of women for over 35 years, providing a safe, welcoming and non-judgmental space. Much like our kitchens at home, the Sisters Kitchen is about more than just food. Participants gather to share stories, play cards and connect with each other and with the Sistering team.

Many of the women who use Sistering’s services suffer from chronic illnesses that can be aggravated by poor diet. That’s why the Sisters Kitchen is so important and each meal could be a lifesaver. Your contribution would provide the volunteers the means to cook hot eggs for breakfast and help the women facing impossible circumstances find a safe and loving place to have breakfast.
<h2>Nella 16"" Stainless Steel Countertop Electric Griddle</h2>
We’re asking Troopers to come together to help purchase the electric griddle for the Sisters Kitchen. The discount supplier price tag for the griddle is $599.00 + tax, but the ability to provide eggs as a part of a well-balanced breakfast for women in need is truly priceless.

For over 35 years they have given a voice and hope to Toronto’s most vulnerable women, including homeless and transient women, women leaving abusive situations, widowed and pensionless women and young women involved in sex work and drug use.

Their doors are open 24/7 to offer a safe, welcoming place. In addition to providing the basic necessities – hot food, shower and laundry facilities, clothes, internet access and a mailing address; they also provide the not so basic services like harm reduction support, counselling, peer support, onsite primary healthcare, access to settlement workers and 24/7 drop-in support.

It’s the combination of these programs and the multi-service agency approach that allows Sistering to effectively meet the needs of its members.";"Cooking eggs for 200 people is no yolk, but an electric griddle could really help!";"962 Bloor St West Toronto, Ontario, Canada M6H 1L6";"Open";"599";"2019-12-18 00:00:00";"0";"0";"0";"No";;"No";;;"Yes";"Yes";;"1";"taxable";"1";;;;;;"1";;;;;;"84881";"no";;"instock";;;"22";"no";"yes";"0";;;"1";"open";;;;;"85232,85276";;;;;"0";"yes";"no";;;;;;"-1";"-1";;;;;;;;;"Needs story";"main need,sistering";"Toronto";"Ontario";"Women's needs";"Sistering";"

"Please don’t stop the music-music-music – with your help, we won’t have to";"85146";"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music is a powerful tool that influences our mood and impacts the atmosphere around us. Breakaway Addiction Services uses music as a means to help set a welcoming tone in its lobby. Different kinds of music can garner a variety of feelings and contribute to creating a safe and inclusive space. The lobby music at Breakaway helps foster a friendly atmosphere for their members - until the phone rings. Currently, the music is connected through the service’s phone system. When a call to Breakaway Services comes in, it cuts out the song and completely disrupts the atmosphere.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Breakaway services is dedicated to providing accessible, barrier-free programs that all start with a warm welcome in the lobby. Whether you “like that old time rock and roll” or “the old town road,” music, in general, can help us feel better and set the tone of a room. Billy Joel once said: “music in itself is healing. It’s an explosive expression of humanity. It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music.” Charities like Breakaway rarely have budget for items like a sound system. So they're faced with a choice: they can either endure the incessant ringing or hope they have neighbours who are willing to step up to help. Your donation can help us create a comfortable safe haven for the Breakaway members who need our support.</span>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’re asking for a contribution that will go towards giving the gift of two wireless speakers; $49.99 each so that the music continues for Breakaway clients – uninterrupted. Your generosity means the only time we’ll hear ringing is when we’re listening to the Lady Gaga and Beyoncé chart topper “Telephone.”</span>
